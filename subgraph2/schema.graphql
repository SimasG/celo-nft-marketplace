# This file defines the entities, or the types, of data that make up the set of possible data
# you want to query on the service. If you have ever worked with traditional databases,
# like MongoDB or MySQL before, you can think of Entities as models or tables in the database,
# where each piece of data needs to conform to that type.

# ** The whole point of doing this is being able to fetch all active listings
# ** at any given point, so we can display them on our dApp properly.
type ListingEntity @entity {
  id: ID!
  nftAddress: Bytes! # address
  tokenId: BigInt! # uint256
  price: BigInt! # uint256
  seller: Bytes! # address
  # The exclamation mark (!) resembles a *required* property
  # Lack of an exclamation mark resembles an optional property
  # Since the listing will not have a buyer until it is sold,
  # We mark the buyer as an optional property
  buyer: Bytes # address
}
